 This dataset "Global Missing Migrants" provides a comprehensive record of missing migrants and their tragic journeys towards international destinations , collected by the Missing Migrants Project, an initiative implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) since 2014. The dataset documents deaths and disappearances, shedding light on the challenges migrants face during their journeys. Please note that due to the complexities of data collection, the figures presented are likely an undercount. The dataset serves as a tribute to the individuals who lost their lives, as well as the families and communities impacted by their absence.
